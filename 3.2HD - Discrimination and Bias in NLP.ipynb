    "Words must be represented as **numeric vectors** in order to be fed into machine learning algorithms. One of the most powerful (and popular) ways to do it is through **Word Embeddings**. In word embedding models, each word in a given language is assigned to a high-dimensional vector, such that **the geometry of the vectors captures relations between the words**. \n",

In linear algebra, we say that the 49 dimensional $g_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular (or \"orthogonal\") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$.

    "These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but are not perfect and do not eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with such variants as well.  \n",
